# Virtual Canvas 🎨🖐️

Write on your screen like magic — no mouse, just your fingers!

## 🧠 What is Virtual Canvas?
Virtual Canvas allows you to draw in the air using hand gestures captured by your webcam.  
Think of it like turning your finger into a digital brush — live on your screen.  
You can switch between 6 different colors and even use an eraser!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
